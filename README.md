# Pok√©dex Project
**This is a class project made by [me](https://github.com/NefloArt) as a practise exercise for my [school](http://www.iesalvarofalomir.es).**

This project consists of an Android App that retrieves data from the public API **[PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co)**.
For the moment it shows Pokemon and Items.

This app uses:
-  MVVM (Model View View Model) structure to update the values when calling the API.
- ViewBinding to manage the views on a layout dynamically
- Retrofit2 to retrieve data from the API
- Glide to load images from the internet into ImageViews
- AndroidX Palette to get the dominant color of an image
- Navigation Graph to manage navigation between fragments
- Navigation Controller to navigate through fragments in the Drawer Layout accessible from the orange button at the left
